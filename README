Author: Lu√≠s Rodrigues
Version: 1.2

Google Chrome extension to replace Arial on every page with the superior Helvetica typeface. It scans the DOM CSS of the document for the 'font' and 'font-family' attributes and rewrites them.

Please note that Helvetica is not packaged with this extension, and you must have it on your computer for correct font replacement.
